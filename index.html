    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: blue;">You must be transparent about how you handle user data (for example, information that you collect about users or that are provided by users, including device information). This means that you must disclose information about the access, collection, use and sharing of data, and may use the data only for the purposes for which it is disclosed. In addition, if your application processes personal and sensitive user data, please see other requirements in the "Users sensitive and personal data" section below. These requirements are in addition to any requirements set forth in applicable privacy and data protection laws. If you include third-party code (e.g. an SDK) in your app, you must ensure that the third-party code used in the app also complies with our Developer Program Policies.

        Personal and sensitive data of users
        Users' private and sensitive data includes, but is not limited to, personally identifiable information, financial and billing information, authentication information, contacts, contact information, device location information, and more. device, SMS and call related data, Health Connect data, list of other apps on the device, microphone, camera, usage data or other sensitive device related data. If your application handles private and sensitive user data, you must meet the following requirements:
        
        Access, collect, use, and share private and sensitive user data obtained through the application only for purposes directly related to providing and improving the functionality of the application (e.g. e.g. functionality expected by users, stated as well as advertised in the above app description). Sharing private and sensitive user data includes the use of SDKs or other third-party services that expose data to third parties. Apps that use private and sensitive user data to serve ads must comply with our Advertising Policies.
        Securely handle all private and sensitive user data, including transmissions thereof, using modern encryption (for example, over HTTPS).
        Request permissions at runtime whenever possible, before accessing data controlled by Android permissions.
        Private and sensitive user data may not be sold.
        Consent requirements and prominent disclosure
        In cases where the user has no reasonable reason to believe that you need their personal and sensitive data to provide or improve policy-compliant features or functionality in the application (e.g. such as background data collection by apps), you must meet the following requirements:
        
        You must disclose information in the application about data access, collection, use and sharing. Information published in the application:
        
        Must be in the app, not just in the app description or on a web page;
        Must be visible during normal application use and should not require the user to navigate to a menu or settings mode;
        Must describe the data you access or collect;
        Must explain how you will use and/or share the data;
        Must not appear only in privacy policy or terms of service; and
        Must not be accompanied by other disclosures unrelated to the collection of private and sensitive user data.
        The information published in the application must accompany and appear immediately before the message asking the user for consent and permission at the start of the run (if any). You may not access or collect private and sensitive data without user consent. In-app user consent message:
        
        The consent dialog must be clearly presented;
        Must explicitly require the user to consent (e.g. tap to accept, tick a checkbox);
        The user's departure from the published content (including pressing the exit button, back button or home screen button) must not be considered as an action to express consent; and
        Auto-close or auto-expiring notifications should not be used as a means of obtaining user consent.
        To meet the policy requirements, you should refer to the following examples of Featured Disclosures as needed:
        
        “[This app] collects/transmits/synchronizes/stores [data types] to provide ["features"], [in any case]."
        For example, “Fitness Funds collects location data to provide fitness tracking even when you close or don't use the app. In addition, location data is also used to support advertising.”
        For example: “Call buddy t"
